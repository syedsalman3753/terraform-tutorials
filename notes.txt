# Terraform

What is the Terraform Refresh Command? By running terraform refresh after making manual changes to your infrastructure resources, you ensure that your Terraform state file is up-to-date and reflects the current state of your infrastructure resources.



## Providers
    Providers are a logical abstraction of an upstream API. They are responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources.


$ terraform init

  ```
    Initializing the backend...

    Initializing provider plugins...
    - Finding integrations/github versions matching "6.2.1"...
    - Installing integrations/github v6.2.1...
    - Installed integrations/github v6.2.1 (signed by a HashiCorp partner, key ID 38027F80D7FD5FB2)

    Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
    If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
    https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html

    Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
    selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
    so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
    you run "terraform init" in the future.

    Terraform has been successfully initialized!

    You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
    any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
    should now work.

    If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
    rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
    commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
